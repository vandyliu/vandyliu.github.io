      <description>Website   Our intro to relational database course has a capstone project where you make an application that has a bunch of SQL commands.

      <description>UBC classroom   Using Python, Selenium and BeautifulSoup4, I was able to create a bot that automatically registered me in UBC courses once a spot was available. There are other services similar to this one out there, but I wanted to be a little different. Almost all the other services available (paid and free) only notify you once a spot is available. I wanted to actually automatically register you in it.</description>
