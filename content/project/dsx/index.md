*Languages/Technologies: Node.js, AWS Lambda, MongoDB*

An Alexa skill designed to make keeping track of attedance for after-school programs easier. Parents can quickly check their child out with their voice. The supervisors can also see who is still here and who has left with a web UI designed with React. The application was made to help a Boys and Kids club in the Seattle area. We used a MongoDB database and AWS Lambda to run our Alexa skill. Read more [here](../../p/seattle-trip/).
