      <description>I’ve been playing soccer for the past 15 years of my life. I love everything about the game and I enjoy playing it a ton. After high school ended, there wasn’t much opportunity for me to play and I got caught up in a lot of other things like school and work. However, I started dropping in at this indoor soccer event every Thursday. Because I missed the registration date, I am not a registered player and can only play if there aren’t enough registered players willing to play that day.</description>

If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen my other blog post, make sure to read it first.
In the past summer, when I was happy with my project, I decided to host it on heroku and github pages and leave it be until the season started. Once the pre-season started, I noticed a major problem: the boxscores did not update until the game finished.</description>

BoxScoreQ is a website to keep you updated on NBA games and their box scores quickly. Whenever I come home from work or school, I open up and see what NBA games I should tune in to. However, I would always want to look at the box score first to see if there is a particular game that might interest me like a game where Derrick Rose currently has 41 points or a game where Klay Thompson is 6-7 from 3 point range.</description>

      <description>For the past three months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to make a website with Jekyll by taking this repository and making it my own. Unluckily for me, it never worked out. Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough knowledge about Ruby or Jekyll to figure out how to solve the issues I was having even though the webpage loaded well locally.
Because of my stubbornness, I never wanted to give up on it but I think it is finally the time.</description>

      <description>Welcome!!! :) Hello world, this is my first blog post.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been the type of kid to focus solely on school and my grades. It was always hard for me to learn stuff outside of school, even if it interested me. Like most kids, I had phases where I wanted to learn things like the guitar or play ice hockey. I would take up a few lessons and then quit because I never wanted to put in the time to learn.</description>
