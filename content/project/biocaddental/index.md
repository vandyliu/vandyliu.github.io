With a friend, we worked together to recreate [biocaddental.ca](https://biocaddental.ca) using Wix.
I also did a little bit of coding in Google Apps Script. In particular, I automated how pictures in a form are organized in Google Drive for ease of access. I also learned a little bit about DNS, CNames and MX records.
