      <description>Amazon Vancouver   This past week was my last week as an intern at Amazon. It was an incredible experience, where I learned not only a lot about programming and code, but about the deployment cycle, what work is like, and so many more things.
What I worked on
Unfortunately, I cannot go into much detail about what I worked on this Summer. I will say that it was an internal developer tool that is frequently used by engineers.</description>

      <description>Our hackathon presentation   This past week Amazon flew me and all the other Amazon Future Engineer (AFE) interns out to Seattle for a hackathon and a music festival. This would be the second hackathon I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. The first one I did was XD Hacks at UBC. At this hackathon, the challenge was to make an Alexa skill for one of three non-profit organizations. Our team built an Alexa skill for the Boys and Girls Club of Washington.</description>
