      <description>Website   Our intro to relational database course has a capstone project where you make an application that has a bunch of SQL commands. With two others, we created a simple website which is supposed to be used to display VALORANT stats such as match history and team information. VALORANT is a multiplayer first person shooter game made by Riot Games that is very popular currently (2020).</description>

      <description>Device Simulator Express   Check it out here
This was an open-source project I worked on while interning at Microsoft. With 3 other interns, we contributed to an existing project that was started by a previous Microsoft garage cohort. We added two new microcontrollers (BBC micro:bit and Adafruit CLUE) as well as enhanced the application quite a bit by adding new features such as virtual environment support, new templates and more.</description>

If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen my other blog post, make sure to read it first.
In the past summer, when I was happy with my project, I decided to host it on heroku and github pages and leave it be until the season started. Once the pre-season started, I noticed a major problem: the boxscores did not update until the game finished.</description>

BoxScoreQ is a website to keep you updated on NBA games and their box scores quickly. Whenever I come home from work or school, I open up and see what NBA games I should tune in to. However, I would always want to look at the box score first to see if there is a particular game that might interest me like a game where Derrick Rose currently has 41 points or a game where Klay Thompson is 6-7 from 3 point range.</description>
