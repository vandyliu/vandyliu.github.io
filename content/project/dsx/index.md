This was an open-source project I worked on while interning at Microsoft. With 3 other interns, we contributed to an existing project that was started by a previous Microsoft garage cohort. We added two new microcontrollers (BBC micro:bit and Adafruit CLUE) as well as enhanced the application quite a bit by adding new features such as virtual environment support, new templates and more. When we first got the project, it had 1,500 installs, and now it's past 10,000!

The application is a VS Code extension that allows you to write Python code and simulate it on our microcontroller simulators. The idea is that you don't have to deploy your code to the device everytime and intead you can test it out on our simulator. 

Some other cool things about the project:
- We met with two professors from universities in the US that use the application in their 1xx/2xx level courses to teach programming
- We planned to have it be used by the Microsoft TEALS program to help young people learn how to code
- We were on a Python podcast, [**Talk Python To Me**](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/272/no-iot-things-in-hand-simulate-them-with-device-simulator-express) to talk about it
- There was going to be something about this at PyCon 2020 (before it got cancelled)
