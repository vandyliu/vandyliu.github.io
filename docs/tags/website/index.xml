      <description>Website picture   With a friend, we worked together to recreate biocaddental.ca using Wix. I also did a little bit of coding in Google Apps Script. In particular, I automated how pictures in a form are organized in Google Drive for ease of access. I also learned a little bit about DNS, CNames and MX records.</description>
