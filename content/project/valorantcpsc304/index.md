Our intro to relational database course has a capstone project where you make an application that has a bunch of SQL commands. With two others, we created a simple website which is supposed to be used to display [VALORANT](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) stats such as match history and team information. VALORANT is a multiplayer first person shooter game made by Riot Games that is very popular currently (2020).
